                <p>Youth is a wonderful experience which happens only once! By the time we realize the value of this gift, it’s time for us to step into the next stage of manhood. It comes, it sees, it goes. There are two categories: first, those who do not realize the transiency of youth and lose out on its glory and charm and second, those who appreciate youth, wake up early, pull on their socks and get set go for the big game!</p>
    
                <p>J.I.I.T. Youth Club is the second category. It stands for the youth brigade. It commands for the hall of fame. It promises, it acts, it delivers. You’ve probably already wondered what JIIT will be like. Will it be as comfortable as your home? Will it be as fun filled as your high school experience? Will you be too much stress, scary and nerve wracking? Or will it be a cornucopia of varied experiences, from books to fields, from labs to clubs, from lectures to events? Lo and behold guys! At JIIT, JYC gives you a breath of fresh air…a break from the mundane activities…a life where each one is appreciated and welcomed!</p>
                
                <p>JYC is the sole student body of the college that believes in furthering the holistic development of the youth and strives to provide a nurturing climate, a trusting environment, and a soil of celebrations. With events, fests, parties, and treks the club aspires to maintain high levels of enthusiasm and team integration. Be it the colors of cultural club, or the parley of the literary hub, be it the mechanics of the robotics or expertise of the technical club, JYC offers it all! Apart from serving as a retreat from intense academic loads, these extracurricular activities present an opportunity that builds confidence, encourages teamwork and gives students a strong sense of achievement and belongingness.</p>
                
                <p>For the J.I.I.T. Youth Club there is too much to do too soon! Members have come, members have gone and the club goes on forever. We bow to time and live it up to the fullest! JYC is about living every moment!</p></h3>
